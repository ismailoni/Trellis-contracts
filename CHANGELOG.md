## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `shared::export`: Permission-aware export pipeline with bounded memory chunking, in-flight cancellation, multi-module role authorization (Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, Marketplace), forbidden field purging, and cumulative SHA-256 stream digests; see `docs/EXPORT_PIPELINE.md`
- `shared::audit_ledger`: an append-only, hash-chained ledger for privileged and financial events (roles, config, upgrades, pause/unpause, treasury/aid/escrow/referral/governance/oracle/marketplace value movement) with on-chain `verify_chain`, permissioned bounded `export_ledger`, storage-free `verify_export`, a publishable head-checkpoint event, and tamper-detection tests (#233); see `docs/AUDIT_LEDGER.md`
- `shared::operational_metadata`: Data minimization review and retention enforcement for operational metadata across Treasury, Aid, Referral, Governance, Oracle, and Marketplace modules with classification, redundant field pruning, two-phase testable deletion, hold management, and migration adapters (#229); see `docs/OPERATIONAL_METADATA_RETENTION.md`
- Two-step ownership transfer with pending acceptance and expiry in `shared::auth` and `contracts/access-control`, requiring explicit cryptographic acceptance by the target owner, supporting automatic expiry rejection, and allowing cancellation before acceptance (#150); see `docs/ACCESS_CONTROL.md`
- `shared::lifecycle_events`: a canonical, versioned event envelope (`("lifecycle", resource, transition)` with schema version, resource ID, from/to state, actor, and timestamp) for every lifecycle transition, plus an ordered-sequence assertion harness (`testing::lifecycle_events`) that fails tests when an expected event is missing or reordered (#144); see `docs/LIFECYCLE_EVENTS.md`
- `shared::disclosure`: progressive disclosure of transaction detail fields, where a `Critical`-severity field can never end up reachable only through the advanced/expanded view (#125)
- Machine-readable changelog (`changelog/entries.json` + `changelog/schema.json`) for protocol-facing changes, validated in CI (#126); see `docs/CHANGELOG_SCHEMA.md`
- Fault-injection test suite (`testing/src/fault_injection.rs`) exercising the sandbox's fake oracle/token/RPC adapters for hard failures, staleness, insufficient balance, and submission timeouts, proving each fails actionably with no partial state (#127)
- PR checklist enforcement (`scripts/check-pr-checklist.cjs`, new `release-readiness.yml` workflow) so an incomplete `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` checklist fails CI instead of only reviewer attention; documented in `docs/RELEASE_READINESS.md` (#128)
- Cross-contract integration test suite covering full aid lifecycle, expiry flows, authorization boundaries, partial failure recovery, and referral commission distribution
- WASM size budget check in CI with per-contract limits and PR comments showing size deltas
- Automated API documentation publishing to GitHub Pages on every merge to main
- Improved crate-level rustdoc for all core contracts (aid, treasury, referral, oracle, registry)
- Landing page for API documentation explaining contract relationships and navigation

### Changed
- Enhanced rustdoc crate-level documentation with usage examples and cross-references
- Updated CI workflow to include WASM size measurement step

### Fixed
- Restored `shared/src/lib.rs`, which was truncated mid-file with a malformed `no_std` attribute, invalid module declarations, and duplicate re-exports, so the `shared` crate (and everything depending on it) could not compile. The module list and re-exports were reconstructed from the last intact revision plus the newer `release_readiness` module, and several latent compile errors in `shared` (over-long `symbol_short!` values, unencodable `Option<user-defined type>` contract fields, missing imports, duplicate `ensure_supported_version`/`is_supported_version` re-exports) were corrected without changing public behavior.
- `shared`'s `health`, `reconciliation`, and `telemetry` modules were re-exported (`pub use health::{...}` etc.) without a matching `mod` declaration in `shared/src/lib.rs` — an unresolved-module compile error for the whole workspace. Added the three missing `pub mod` declarations.

## Versioning Strategy

The Trellis Contracts project uses a hybrid versioning approach:

### Repository Version
- Follows Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Incremented when contract suite interfaces or behaviors change significantly
- Used for releases and documentation

### Individual Contract Versions
- Each contract tracks its own version in the upgradeability registry
- Allows independent contract updates without forcing suite-wide version bumps
- Critical for the on-chain upgrade system where contract identity is preserved across versions

See [UPGRADEABILITY.md](./UPGRADEABILITY.md) for details on the on-chain upgrade registry and version tracking.
